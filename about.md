This is my blog, which is intended to host articles on my open source work.
I mainly contribute to the [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) project since late 2019, but also sent a few patches to [QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/) and randomly to other projects.

### Contact me

I'm participating in the SerenityOS discord server, so you may find me there under the same name (`supercomputer7`).
